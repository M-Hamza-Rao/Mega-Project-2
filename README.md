Title: Demand Forecasting Using Walmart Store Sales Data

1. Project Overview

Objective: Predict future sales for Walmart stores using historical sales data and external factors like holidays, weather, and economic indicators.

Key Benefits:

Improve inventory management

Reduce stockouts and overstocking

Optimize supply chain efficiency

Dataset Used:

Walmart Store Sales Dataset (Kaggle)

External Datasets:

Weather Data – NOAA Global Weather Data (Temperature, Rainfall, Snowfall)

Holiday Data – Global Holiday Dataset

Economic Indicators – US Economic Indicators (FRED) (Inflation, Unemployment, Fuel Prices)

2. Step-by-Step Approach

Step 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing

Gather Data: Download Walmart Sales Data and external datasets.

Merge External Data:

Match weather data with store locations and dates.

Merge holiday data based on the date.

Integrate economic indicators on a weekly level.

Handle Missing Values: Fill missing values using interpolation or forward-fill techniques.

Feature Engineering:

Time Features: Extract Month, Quarter, Week, and Year.

Lag Features: Create sales lag features (last 7, 14, 30 days).

Rolling Statistics: Compute moving averages for sales trends.

Categorical Encoding: Convert categorical variables (Store Type, Holiday) to numerical.

Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Seasonality Analysis: Visualize sales trends over months and years.

Correlation Analysis: Check relationships between sales and external factors (e.g., holidays, weather, fuel prices).

Outlier Detection: Identify and handle anomalies in sales data.

Step 3: Model Selection & Training

Baseline Model: Start with a simple moving average model for initial benchmarking.

Time Series Models:

ARIMA/SARIMA (For trend and seasonality adjustments)

Prophet (Facebook’s forecasting model for handling external regressors like holidays)

Machine Learning Models:

Random Forest, XGBoost, or LightGBM (for regression-based demand forecasting)

Neural Networks (LSTM/GRU) for deep learning-based forecasting

Step 4: Model Evaluation & Optimization

Metrics to Evaluate:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize ML models using Grid Search or Bayesian Optimization.

Feature Selection: Use SHAP values to identify the most influential factors in demand forecasting.

Step 5: Deployment & Visualization

Deploy Model Using: Flask API / Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

Dashboard: Build an interactive dashboard using Power BI or Tableau to visualize forecasts.

Automated Reporting: Schedule automated reports using Python (pandas & scheduling libraries).

Step 6: Business Insights & Recommendations

Adjust Inventory Levels: Based on peak demand periods.

Optimize Pricing Strategies: Align promotions with high-demand seasons.

Improve Supply Chain Planning: Use forecasts to streamline logistics.

3. Expected Outcomes

Accurate demand predictions with reduced forecasting error.

Insights into the effect of weather, holidays, and economic factors on sales.

Improved decision-making for store managers and supply chain teams.

4. Tools & Technologies Used

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras

Time Series Forecasting Models: ARIMA, SARIMA, Prophet

Visualization: Power BI / Tableau

Data Storage & Processing: SQL / BigQuery (if needed for large-scale data)
